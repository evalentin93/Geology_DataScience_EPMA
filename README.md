# Hello world!

Hello! My name is Eduardo Valentin and, for now, this is a collection of python programming projects involving geology and routine science work.

### Scripts for Routine Science Work

The goal of this project is to build basic python scripts for routine science work, like gather information from scientific publications, visualization of data, replication of well known geologic diagrams and graphs.

Future perspectives involve refine my work and build more sofisticated general purpose algorithms.

### Data Science for Geochemistry

The goal of this project is to help users that are unfamiliar with the EPMA data handling and classification. 

As I am learning to program with python, I wish to develop a script that can discriminate between the most common rock-forming minerals, calculate their mineral formula individually and plot them in the most common graphics used for classification.

My goal is to construct and train a machine learning algorithm that can do all this and maybe present this script in a more user-friendly manner.

To develop such a project there are a few stepping stones to achieve, such as develop an adequate database to train the algorithm and become more mature in the python language.

Future perspectives involve maybe expand this project to treat data of other analytical techniques, such as ICP-MS, it would be great to develop something similar to Isoplot, without using Excel.
