# Geology_DataScience_EPMA

Hello! My name is Eduardo Valentin and, for now, this is a collection of data science projects involving EPMA mineral formula calculations and data plotting.

The goal of this project is to help users that are unfamiliar with the EPMA data handling and classification. 

As I am learning to program with python, I wish to develop a script that can discriminate between the most common rock-forming minerals, calculate their mineral formula individually and plot them in the most common graphics used for classification.

My goal is to construct and train a machine learning algorithm that can do all this and maybe present this script in a more user-friendly manner.

To develop such a project there a few stepping stones to achieve, such as develop an adequate database to train the algorithm and become more mature in the python language.
